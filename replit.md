# E-Code Clone Project

## Overview
A comprehensive web-based IDE that clones Replit.com exactly, then adds unique features. The project focuses on pixel-perfect replication of Replit's interface and functionality, built with React, TypeScript, and advanced web technologies, now rebranded as E-Code.

## User Preferences
- **Vision**: Create exact pixel-perfect clone of replit.com first, then add personal features, rebranded as E-Code
- **Development Approach**: Systematic implementation following detailed roadmap
- **Communication**: Direct, concise updates with clear progress indicators
- **Architecture**: Modern full-stack with React frontend, Express backend, PostgreSQL database

## Project Architecture

### Frontend
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS with custom E-Code theme variables
- Monaco Editor for advanced code editing
- xterm.js for terminal integration
- Radix UI components with shadcn/ui styling

### Backend
- Express.js with TypeScript
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
- WebSocket support for real-time features
- Authentication system with session management

### Key Components Created
- **ReplitLayout**: Main layout system matching E-Code's exact structure
- **ReplitHeader**: Navigation header with search, menus, user profile
- **ReplitSidebar**: File explorer and project tools
- **ReplitMonacoEditor**: Advanced code editor with E-Code theming
- **ReplitFileExplorer**: Interactive file system with drag/drop
- **ReplitTerminal**: Full-featured terminal with multiple sessions

## User Preferences - Public Website Messaging
- **IMPORTANT**: The public website should emphasize that E-Code is NOT just for developers
- Make it clear this is a platform for everyone: beginners, students, hobbyists, artists, entrepreneurs
- Use inclusive language: "learners", "creators", "people" instead of just "developers"
- Focus on accessibility, learning, and creativity rather than technical development
- Emphasize that no prior coding experience is needed
