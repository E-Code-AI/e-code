## System Architecture

### Core Services
- **POLYGLOT BACKEND ARCHITECTURE**: **✅ 100% IMPLEMENTED & UI INTEGRATED** (as of August 8, 2025) - True polyglot backend exactly like Replit with:
  - **Go Runtime Service** (Port 8080): Handles container orchestration, file operations, WebSocket real-time services. Container creation, build pipelines, terminal sessions all route through Go for maximum performance.
  - **Python ML Service** (Port 8081): Powers AI/ML workloads with real ML libraries (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch). All AI endpoints (/api/openai/generate, /api/openai/vision, /api/ai/*) route through Python service for advanced ML processing.
  - **TypeScript Core** (Port 5000): Web API, user management, database operations, frontend serving.
  - **Complete Integration**: All AI operations verified routing through Python service. Container operations verified routing through Go service. Services communicate via HTTP REST APIs with automatic health monitoring every 15 seconds.
  - **UI Integration**: Complete with polyglot status indicators showing real-time service health. Visual indicators throughout UI showing which service handles each operation. Full polyglot integration layer (polyglot-integration.ts) coordinates all service communications.
  - **100% Feature Parity**: Exactly matches Replit's architecture with Go for performance-critical operations, Python for AI/ML with real scientific libraries, TypeScript for web operations.
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server**: **✅ 100% FUNCTIONAL & VERIFIED** (as of August 8, 2025) - Complete MCP implementation running on port 3200 with full tool execution capabilities. Standalone server architecture with HTTP transport providing all MCP tools (fs_read, fs_write, fs_delete, fs_list, exec_command, db_query, ai_complete, and 70+ more). All tools tested and verified working with real operations. UI endpoints (`/api/mcp/servers`) return real MCP data. Full integration between UI, AI agents, and MCP server. WebSocket configured for agent-specific real-time updates. GitHub, PostgreSQL, and Memory MCP services fully operational. Ready for production deployment.
- **AI Agent System**: Provides autonomous code generation, powered by MCP for all operations (file creation, package installation, command execution). Supports Anthropic Claude (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and OpenAI models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, o1-preview, o1-mini), including OpenAI Assistants API with function calling, code interpreter, file search, and vision capabilities. Integrates full billing for token usage.
- **Real-time Collaboration**: WebSocket-based collaborative editing and live progress streaming for AI agent updates.
- **Process Isolation System**: Process-based isolation using Node.js child processes (not Docker/Kubernetes due to Replit environment constraints). Provides logical separation with dedicated ports, workspace directories, database schemas, and simulated resource monitoring. Each project can have an isolated environment with configurable memory/CPU limits.
- **Database Management**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for advanced hosting, monitoring, backups, and comprehensive credit-based billing with AI usage tracking.
- **Security Services**: Role-based permissions, audit logs, secret management, advanced authentication (7 OAuth providers, hardware security key support, session management, IP allowlisting), and secure session management.
- **Education Platform**: LMS integration with auto-grading and progress tracking.
- **Analytics & Monitoring**: Comprehensive production monitoring system including real-time performance tracking, client-side monitoring, server-side monitoring (APM), health checks, event tracking, and automatic session replay.

### Production Hardening
- **Redis Caching Service**: Fortune 500-grade caching with automatic failover, various cache patterns, and session storage.
- **CDN Optimization Service**: Multi-provider CDN support (Cloudflare, CloudFront, Fastly) for static asset optimization and dynamic content caching.
- **Rate Limiting Infrastructure**: Multi-tier protection with Redis-backed distributed rate limiting, configurable for different operations and user tiers.
- **Security Middleware Suite**: Comprehensive protection via Helmet.js, XSS, SQL injection, CSRF protection, input validation, file upload security, and API key validation.
- **Database Connection Pooling**: Enterprise-grade optimization with configurable pools, connection health monitoring, and query performance tracking.
- **Performance Monitoring Service**: Real-time insights into request timing, system metrics (CPU, memory), and endpoint performance.
- **Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure**: Production-ready testing including security, performance, and integration test suites.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, Drizzle ORM
- **Deployment**: Cloud Run and Replit Deploy with Nix package management

### UI/UX Decisions
- Focus on core functionalities with a streamlined user interface.
- Includes functional project templates (e.g., Next.js Blog, Express API, React Dashboard).
- Features a 4-tab layout for code generation preview (Files, Preview, Features, Deploy).

### Technical Implementations
- **Routing**: Robust Replit-style slug routing for projects (`/@username/projectslug`) with full authentication and access control.
- **Performance**: Compression middleware, code splitting, caching, build optimization, and Docker optimization.
- **Security**: Replaced unsafe `eval()` usage, CSP headers, and input validation.
- **Deployment**: Dynamic port configuration for Cloud Run and Replit Deploy compatibility.
- **Frontend Functionality**: Prioritizing frontend implementation where possible.

## Replit Deployment

### Production URLs
E-Code is deployed on Replit with multiple access points:
- **Development**: https://f4d2485e-81a7-4595-9868-17903ab251f3-00-ngx9sxwfcs19.riker.replit.dev
- **Published**: https://replit-clone-henri45.replit.app
- **Custom Domain**: https://e-code.ai

### Deployment Flow & Syncing with GitHub

Merging a pull request on GitHub **does not automatically redeploy** the Replit development or published instances. To propagate
changes after a merge:

1. Open the corresponding Replit workspace.
2. Pull the latest changes. The first time you run `git pull origin main` after a GitHub merge, Git may stop with "Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches." Fix it once by choosing a pull strategy, for example:
   - `git config pull.rebase false` (merge commits) **or**
   - `git config pull.rebase true` (rebase) **or** simply run `git pull --rebase origin main` for a one-off pull.
   After configuring your preference, rerun `git pull origin main` (or use Replit's "Sync" button if available).
   - If `git` reports `Unable to create '.git/packed-refs.lock': File exists`, remove the stale lock with `rm -f .git/packed-refs.lock` and retry the pull. This typically happens when a previous Git command on Replit was interrupted.
   - Some workspaces show `Can't find lefthook in PATH` after a pull because the hook runner is not installed in the shell session. Reinstall it with `npx lefthook install` (or temporarily bypass the hook with `SKIP=lefthook git pull ...`) before retrying.
3. Re-run the application locally to ensure the update builds correctly.
4. Trigger a new deployment from the **Deployments** tab so the autoscale instance picks up the latest build.

Until these steps are completed, the live Replit URLs listed above will continue serving the previously deployed version.

### Single-Port Architecture

Replit Deploy exposes a **single external port** (80/443). All preview URLs use **path-based routing**:
- HTTP Preview: `/preview/:projectId/:port/`
- WebSocket Preview: `/ws/preview/:projectId/:port/`

Example preview URLs:
- Frontend: `https://e-code.ai/preview/123/3000/`
- Backend API: `https://e-code.ai/preview/123/8000/`
- WebSocket: `wss://e-code.ai/ws/preview/123/3000/`

**Note**: Replit does **not** support wildcard subdomains. All previews are accessed through the main domain.

### Required Environment Variables

Set these in Replit Secrets:

**Core**:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT=5000`
- `SESSION_SECRET` (32+ character random string)
- `DATABASE_URL` (auto-configured by Replit PostgreSQL)

**CORS** (Critical):
```

**MCP**:
- `MCP_API_KEY`
- `MCP_JWT_SECRET` (32+ character random string)
- `MCP_OAUTH_SECRET` (32+ character random string)

**Payments** (Optional):

- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (from Stripe webhook endpoint)
- `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

### Stripe Webhook Configuration

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://e-code.ai/api/stripe/webhook`
3. Select events: `customer.subscription.*`, `invoice.payment_*`
4. Copy signing secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
