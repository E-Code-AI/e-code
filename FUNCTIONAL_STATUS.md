# E-Code Platform Functional Completion Status
## As of August 7, 2025

## What's NOT Working ‚ùå
- AI agent features are currently limited to initialization scaffolding and do not execute any model calls.
- No AI-driven code generation, documentation, or error fixing flows are connected to real providers.

## Recent Fixes Applied (October 17) üîß
- Prepared configuration for OpenAI and Anthropic keys but they are not consumed by the runtime services yet.
- Added autonomous agent initialization logic without hooking it up to actual AI execution backends.
### üìÑ Frontend Pages Status Overview
- Total page files reviewed: 118 (all `.tsx` files in `client/src/pages`)
- Fully implemented UI pages: 47 (rich layouts with more than 160 non-comment code lines)
- Basic templates with placeholder content: 11 (35‚Äì160 lines with minimal wiring and limited data flow)
- Stub or "Coming Soon" style pages: 60 (less than 35 lines or explicit placeholder messaging)
- Methodology: quick heuristic line-count classification run via a local Python script during this review
- Impact: although navigation exists, more than half of the routes still land on placeholder screens, so most links remain non-functional for end users
