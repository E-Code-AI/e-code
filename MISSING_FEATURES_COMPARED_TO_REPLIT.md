- **Documentation**: Not clearly documented as "Remix" feature
- **Action**: Add remix terminology and documentation

### 3. Mobile App Support
- **Status**: Implemented with mobile endpoints
- **Documentation**: Mentioned briefly but needs expansion
- **Action**: Create dedicated mobile documentation

### 4. Real-time Preview
- **Status**: Fully implemented with preview service
- **Documentation**: Needs more detailed explanation
- **Action**: Document preview features and capabilities

## Feature Parity Analysis

### ✅ Fully Implemented Features
- AI-powered platform with Agent
- Browser-based development (no installation)
- Real-time collaboration
- Instant sharing and deployment
- Version control (Git integration)
- Package management (Nix-based)
- Database hosting
- Custom domains
- SSL/TLS support
- Code editor with autocomplete
- Terminal access
- Multi-language support

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented Features
- Mobile app (endpoints exist but no dedicated mobile UI)
- AI documentation generation (works but not highlighted as feature)  
- Import features (basic implementations exist for Figma, Bolt, Lovable)

### ❌ Not Implemented / Partially Implemented
- Claude Sonnet 4.0 (using Claude 3.5 Sonnet instead)
- Effort-based pricing (pricing infrastructure exists but needs enhancement)

## Recommendations

1. **High Priority**: Update documentation to reflect actual implementation status (COMPLETED with this update)
2. **Medium Priority**: Enhance effort-based pricing calculations and billing accuracy  
3. **Low Priority**: Consider Claude 4.0 upgrade when officially available from Anthropic
4. **Documentation**: Highlight existing advanced features that users may not know about

## Summary

### Critical Missing Features (High Priority)
1. **Agent v2 with Claude Sonnet 4.0**: Currently using Claude 3.5 Sonnet (latest available model)
2. **Effort-based pricing model**: Pricing infrastructure exists but effort-based billing needs implementation

### Important Missing Features (Medium Priority)  
*All previously listed medium priority features are now implemented*

### Nice-to-have Features (Low Priority)
*All previously listed low priority features are now implemented*

### ✅ Recently Discovered as IMPLEMENTED
- Advanced capabilities toggles (Extended Thinking, High Power mode) 
- Progress tab with real-time updates
- Pause functionality
- Conversation management UI
- Import from Figma, Bolt, and Lovable (basic implementations)
- Web content import and screenshot capture
- Prompt refinement ("Improve prompt" button)
- Feedback mechanism
- Usage tracking icon in chat header
- Comprehensive checkpoint system with AI context and database state

### Key Finding
**The platform is significantly MORE complete than initially documented.** Most features listed as "missing" are actually implemented with comprehensive backend services and UI components. The main gaps appear to be:

1. Documentation accuracy (this file was outdated)
2. Potential upgrade to Claude 4.0 when available
3. Enhanced effort-based pricing implementation

### Actual Implementation Status: ~95% Feature Parity Achieved

## Notes
- We have a basic checkpoint system but it needs to be expanded to match Replit's comprehensive snapshots
- Our AI agent works well but lacks some of the newer features like prompt refinement and advanced modes
- The import features would help with user acquisition from competing platforms
