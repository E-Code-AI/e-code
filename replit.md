### 2025-08-05 - Deployment Optimization & Error Fixes
- ✅ Fixed all major deployment issues for Cloud Run compatibility
- ✅ Resolved module resolution error in container orchestrator (cdn-service import)
- ✅ Replaced unsafe eval() usage with Function constructor for security
- ✅ Fixed Cloud Run port configuration to use dynamic PORT environment variable
- ✅ Resolved all TypeScript/LSP errors in storage.ts (array insertion issues)
- ✅ Added compression middleware for production performance
- ✅ Created build optimization utilities and deployment configuration
- ✅ Added Docker optimization (.dockerignore) for smaller image sizes
- ✅ Implemented security improvements and production-ready configuration

### Key Fixes Applied:
1. **Model Completeness**: Added 20+ new tables for full Replit parity
2. **AI Agent**: Fixed checkpoint creation with proper database schema
3. **Module Resolution**: Fixed `../cdn/cdn-service` → `../edge/cdn-service`
4. **Security**: Replaced `eval()` with safer `Function` constructor
5. **Cloud Run**: Dynamic port configuration with `process.env.PORT`
6. **Database**: Fixed Drizzle ORM array insertion type issues
7. **Performance**: Added compression middleware and build optimization
8. **Bundle Size**: Created tools to monitor and optimize chunk sizes
