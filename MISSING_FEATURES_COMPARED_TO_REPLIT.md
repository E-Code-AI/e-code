Based on analysis of https://docs.replit.com/getting-started/intro-replit

## Missing Import Features

### 1. Import from Figma
- **Description**: Convert Figma designs into functional React applications
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Implementation Notes**: Would require Figma API integration and design-to-code conversion logic

### 2. Import from Bolt
- **Description**: Migrate Bolt projects to our platform with Agent assistance
- **Status**: Not implemented  
- **Priority**: Low
- **Implementation Notes**: Requires understanding Bolt's project structure and migration tools

### 3. Import from Lovable
- **Description**: Transfer Lovable projects and continue building
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Priority**: Low
- **Implementation Notes**: Similar to Bolt import, needs project structure analysis

## Features We Have But Need Better Documentation

### 1. GitHub Import
- **Status**: Implemented in `server/routes.ts` at `/api/import/github`
- **Documentation**: Not mentioned in main docs
- **Action**: Add to user-facing documentation

### 2. Project Forking/Remixing

- **Documentation**: Not clearly documented as "Remix" feature
- **Action**: Add remix terminology and documentation

### 3. Mobile App Support

- **Documentation**: Mentioned briefly but needs expansion
- **Action**: Create dedicated mobile documentation

### 4. Real-time Preview
- **Status**: Fully implemented with preview service
- **Documentation**: Needs more detailed explanation
- **Action**: Document preview features and capabilities

## Feature Parity Analysis

### ✅ Fully Implemented Features
- AI-powered platform with Agent
- Browser-based development (no installation)
- Real-time collaboration
- Instant sharing and deployment
- Version control (Git integration)
- Package management (Nix-based)
- Database hosting
- Custom domains
- SSL/TLS support
- Code editor with autocomplete
- Terminal access
- Multi-language support

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented Features
- Mobile app (endpoints exist but no dedicated mobile UI)
- AI documentation generation (works but not highlighted as feature)

### ❌ Not Implemented
- Figma import
- Bolt import
- Lovable import

## Recommendations

1. **High Priority**: Document existing features properly
2. **Medium Priority**: Implement Figma import (most useful of the missing imports)
3. **Low Priority**: Implement Bolt and Lovable imports (niche use cases)
