# E-Code Project

## Overview
A comprehensive web-based IDE inspired by Replit, with additional unique features. The project focuses on creating a professional development environment with Replit's interface excellence, built with React, TypeScript, and advanced web technologies, branded as E-Code.

## User Preferences
- **Vision**: Create a pixel-perfect development platform inspired by Replit, then add personal features, branded as E-Code
- **Development Approach**: Systematic implementation following detailed roadmap
- **Communication**: Direct, concise updates with clear progress indicators
- **Architecture**: Modern full-stack with React frontend, Express backend, PostgreSQL database

## Project Architecture

### Frontend
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS with custom E-Code theme variables
- Monaco Editor for advanced code editing
- xterm.js for terminal integration
- Radix UI components with shadcn/ui styling

### Backend
- Express.js with TypeScript
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
- WebSocket support for real-time features
- Authentication system with session management

### Key Components Created
- **ReplitLayout**: Main layout system matching E-Code's exact structure

- **ReplitFileExplorer**: Interactive file system with drag/drop
- **ReplitTerminal**: Full-featured terminal with multiple sessions

## User Preferences - Public Website Messaging
- **IMPORTANT**: The public website should emphasize that E-Code is NOT just for developers
- Make it clear this is a platform for everyone: beginners, students, hobbyists, artists, entrepreneurs
- Use inclusive language: "learners", "creators", "people" instead of just "developers"
- Focus on accessibility, learning, and creativity rather than technical development
- Emphasize that no prior coding experience is needed

## Authentication & Login Information
- **Frontend Login Page**: `/login` - Displays the login form UI for users
- **API Login Status**: `/api/login` - Returns JSON authentication status (not for direct user access)
- **API Login Endpoint**: `/api/login` (POST) - Handles login form submissions
- **Default Test User**: Username: `admin`, Password: `admin` (for development)
