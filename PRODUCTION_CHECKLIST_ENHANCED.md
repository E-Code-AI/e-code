# Production Deployment Checklist - Enhanced

## Pre-Deployment Security Review

### Critical Security Checks
- [ ] **Sandbox Isolation**
  - [ ] Verify seccomp profile blocks dangerous syscalls
  - [ ] Test container runs as non-root user
  - [ ] Confirm no network access in sandbox containers
  - [ ] Validate resource limits (memory, CPU, disk, processes)
  - [ ] Test timeout mechanisms work correctly

- [ ] **Authentication & Authorization**
  - [ ] Change all default passwords and API keys
  - [ ] Implement proper JWT secret rotation
  - [ ] Configure rate limiting on all endpoints
  - [ ] Set up proper CORS policies
  - [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS everywhere

- [ ] **Environment Configuration**
  - [ ] All secrets stored in secure secret manager (not .env files)
  - [ ] Database uses encrypted connections
  - [ ] Redis uses authentication and encryption
  - [ ] S3/Storage uses proper IAM policies

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] **Network Security**
  - [ ] WAF configured and active
  - [ ] DDoS protection enabled
  - [ ] Private networking for internal services
  - [ ] Proper firewall rules

- [ ] **Container Security**
  - [ ] Base images are up to date and from trusted sources
  - [ ] Container images scanned for vulnerabilities
  - [ ] No secrets in container images
  - [ ] Runtime security monitoring enabled

## Performance & Scalability

- [ ] **Resource Planning**
  - [ ] Load testing completed
  - [ ] Auto-scaling configured
  - [ ] Database connection pooling optimized
  - [ ] CDN configured for static assets

- [ ] **Monitoring & Alerting**
  - [ ] Application performance monitoring (APM) set up
  - [ ] Log aggregation and monitoring
  - [ ] Health checks for all services
  - [ ] Alert thresholds configured

## Backup & Recovery

- [ ] **Data Protection**
  - [ ] Database backups automated and tested
  - [ ] File storage backups configured
  - [ ] Disaster recovery plan documented
  - [ ] Regular restore testing

## Compliance & Legal

- [ ] **Data Protection**
  - [ ] GDPR/CCPA compliance reviewed
  - [ ] Data retention policies implemented
  - [ ] User data export/deletion mechanisms
  - [ ] Privacy policy updated

## Go-Live Checklist

### Pre-Launch (T-1 week)
- [ ] Complete security audit
- [ ] Performance testing under load
- [ ] Backup and restore procedures tested
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards configured
- [ ] On-call procedures documented

### Launch Day (T-0)
- [ ] Deploy to production during low-traffic window
- [ ] Monitor error rates and performance metrics
- [ ] Verify all critical user journeys work
- [ ] Test disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Announce launch to stakeholders

### Post-Launch (T+1 week)
- [ ] Review performance metrics
- [ ] Check security alerts and logs
- [ ] User feedback collection
- [ ] Identify and fix any issues
- [ ] Plan next iteration improvements

## Security Recommendations for Public Launch

### Immediate (Critical)
1. **Use Firecracker or gVisor** instead of standard Docker for stronger isolation
2. **Implement billing and quota systems** to prevent resource abuse
3. **Set up comprehensive WAF rules** with request filtering
4. **Enable advanced DDoS protection** with automatic scaling

### Short-term (Important)
1. **Implement user reputation system** to flag suspicious behavior
2. **Add code analysis** to detect potentially malicious code
3. **Set up geographic restrictions** if needed for compliance
4. **Implement audit logging** for all security events

### Long-term (Strategic)
1. **Consider multi-region deployment** for better availability
2. **Implement advanced threat detection** with ML-based analysis
3. **Add SOC 2 compliance** for enterprise customers
4. **Consider bug bounty program** for continuous security testing

## Rollback Plan

### Automated Rollback Triggers
- Error rate > 5% for 5 minutes
- Response time > 2s for 10 minutes
- CPU usage > 90% for 15 minutes
- Any critical security alert

### Manual Rollback Procedure
1. Stop traffic to new version
2. Route traffic to previous stable version
3. Investigate and document issues
4. Plan fixes for next deployment
5. Communicate with stakeholders

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Code execution sandbox bypass** - Could allow arbitrary system access
- **Resource exhaustion attacks** - Could cause service disruption
- **Data exposure** - Could lead to privacy violations

### Mitigation Strategies
- Multiple layers of isolation (containers + seccomp + resource limits)
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Incident response plan with clear escalation procedures

## Final Go/No-Go Decision

This checklist must be 100% complete before public launch. Any unchecked items represent unacceptable risk and require either:
1. Immediate resolution, or
2. Documented risk acceptance by executive leadership

**Deployment Authority:** CTO/Security Officer joint approval required
