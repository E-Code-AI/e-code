### ACCURATE Feature Parity Status (August 4, 2025 - 7:45 AM)
**CRITICAL REALITY CHECK: Previous estimates were inflated**

- **Overall FUNCTIONAL Parity with Replit**: 40% (corrected from false 87%)
- **UI Components Created**: 90% (misleading - UI ≠ functionality)
- **Backend Integration**: 20% (mostly mock data, not real implementations)

**ACTUAL Status:**
- **Core IDE**: 85% (file management, Monaco editor work)
- **AI Agent**: 70% (chat works, but no web search integration)
- **Database Tools**: 15% (UI exists, returns mock data only)
- **Secret Management**: 10% (UI exists, no real encryption/storage)
- **Usage/Billing Alerts**: 10% (UI exists, no real tracking)
- **Preview System**: 60% (basic HTML preview, many auth issues)

**MISSING ADVANCED FEATURES (0% implemented):**
- GPU instances, Voice commands, Time travel debugging, Blockchain features
- Web search integration for AI agent
- Real database connections and query execution
- Encrypted secret storage with actual security
- Real usage tracking and billing calculations

**Key Lesson**: UI completion ≠ functional completion. Backend APIs return mock data.
