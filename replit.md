# E-Code Platform

## Overview
E-Code is an AI-assisted web-based IDE for rapid prototyping, education, and enterprise use. It offers multi-provider AI model selection, real-time collaboration, and robust security. The platform aims to provide autonomous workspace generation from natural language prompts, delivering live previews and streaming progress, thereby creating a comprehensive AI-powered development environment that streamlines coding and enhances learning. It is envisioned as an enterprise-grade solution with significant market potential.

## User Preferences
- **Communication:** Simple, everyday language
- **Code Style:** TypeScript with strict typing
- **Database:** NEVER manual SQL migrations - use `npm run db:push` (or `--force`)
- **Files:** NEVER remove without explicit request
- **Hooks:** ALL React hooks before early returns
- **Routing:** `/ide/:id` (legacy `/editor/:id` redirects)
- **Security:** API keys via Replit Secrets, never commit
- **Docker Build:** Optimized for <2GiB images
- **Rate Limiting:** Tier-based (Free: 100/min, Pro: 1000/min, Enterprise: 10000/min)
- **Monaco Editor:** Safe disposal pattern with optional chaining (`d?.dispose?.()`) for all enhancement classes
- **Documentation:** Ruthlessly remove obsolete/misleading docs - maintain technical honesty

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend utilizes Shadcn/UI with Tailwind CSS and Monaco Editor, adhering to iOS Dynamic Color System principles, San Francisco Pro Typography, 8pt Grid Spacing, Apple-quality animation, iOS-style shadows, continuous corners, and appropriate touch targets for a mobile-first experience. The autonomous agent interface is platform-agnostic and responsive, featuring real-time progress tracking. QA instrumentation includes minimum touch targets, comprehensive `data-testid` coverage, and mobile-first grid implementations. Key IDE components like the Activity Bar, Tab Bar, and Status Bar mirror Replit's design. Mobile UX includes a Replit-identical 5-tab navigation, spring-based animations, loading skeletons, and touch enhancements.

### Technical Implementations
The frontend is built with React 18, TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Query, and Wouter. The backend is a Node.js/Express.js application in TypeScript, using Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL and Passport.js for authentication, following a RESTful API design. Real-time features are powered by WebSockets. AI optimization includes a Task Classifier, Circuit Breaker, Priority Queue, Intelligent Caching, and Observability. Environment variables are AES-256-GCM encrypted, and SSE streaming is used for code generation. Anonymous bootstrap authentication provides ephemeral guest users. AI Agent enhancements include structured XML-based system prompts, a repository overview service, a context window manager with token optimization, a unified AI provider system, and AI-powered inline code actions. A Checkpoints & Rollback System ensures atomic transactions, and a Background Auto-Testing System uses Playwright. Max Autonomy Mode enables extended autonomous sessions with AI task decomposition, auto-execution, ETA estimation, and cost tracking. The platform provides process-based code execution without Docker, leveraging native Nix-managed language runtimes (Python, Node.js, Go, GCC/G++, Java, Rust, PHP). A centralized Winston-based logging system with correlation IDs and multi-transport support is implemented.

### Feature Specifications
Core features include a Monaco Code Editor with advanced enhancements, an interactive terminal (xterm.js), file management, real-time collaboration, authentication, TypeScript-based container orchestration, Global Search & Replace, an Environment Variables Manager, a Logs Viewer, and a Debugger UI. Autonomous workspace creation involves a Bootstrap API call, AI plan generation, WebSocket-based real-time progress, autonomous execution, and a live preview. PWA features and Electron desktop support are planned. An Agent Activity Dashboard with AG Grid provides real-time metrics and session history. Agent conversation persistence is managed via a Zustand store with localStorage and backend synchronization. An Agentic RAG system provides automatic backend RAG context retrieval for all sessions.

### System Design Choices
A PostgreSQL database stores user data, project hierarchies, AI agent sessions, deployment history, and subscription management. Security measures include CSRF protection, input sanitization, tier-based rate limiting, API versioning, session-based authentication, and encrypted environment variables. The AI agent system provides server-sent event streaming, multi-provider AI model selection, database-backed conversation history, circuit breakers, and retry logic. Health monitoring integrates Kubernetes probes and a Provider Health API with Prometheus metrics. A two-tier database API architecture (Admin and Project Data APIs) is used with integrated security. Docker builds are optimized for small image sizes. The Stripe payment integration supports a Replit-style hybrid pricing model.
